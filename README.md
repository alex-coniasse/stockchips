# StockChips (WIP)
A web demo for my hobby chess engine.
https://alex-coniasse.github.io/stockchips/

- The engine is programmed in c++ and compiled for WASM with emscripten.
- This repo contains the (ugly) javascript UI and the engine binaries.
- The engine source does not live on this repository (will probably add it later).
